## What is cloud computing?

<img src="cloud.png">

<br>
<hr>

+ Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics-over the internet ("the cloud").

***On-Demand Self-Service:***

+ Users can provision computing capabilities as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

***Broad Network Access:***

+ Services are accessible over the network and can be used from various devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, PCs).

***Resource Pooling:***

+ Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model. Resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.

***Rapid Elasticity:***

+ Resources can be scaled up or down quickly and elastically, providing a sense of infinite resources when needed.

### Benefits:


+ Cost Efficiency: Reduces the need for large capital expenditures on hardware and software.

+ Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.

+ Accessibility: Access services and data from anywhere with an internet connection.

+ Disaster Recovery: Enhanced disaster recovery solutions and backups are often included.


### Challenges:


+ Security: Protecting sensitive data and ensuring privacy in the cloud can be complex.

+ Compliance: Meeting regulatory requirements for data protection can be challenging.

+ Downtime: Cloud service outages can impact service availability.

+ Vendor Lock-In: Difficulty in migrating services from one cloud provider to another.

### 1. Public Cloud

***Description:*** 

+ Services are delivered over the internet and shared across multiple organizations.

***Characteristics:***


+ Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.

+ Cost-Effective: Pay-as-you-go pricing model with no upfront investment.

+ Maintenance: AWS manages and maintains the infrastructure.

+ Examples: Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS.

+ Use Cases: Suitable for a wide range of applications from web hosting to big data analytics and development/testing environments.

### 2. Private Cloud

***Description:*** 

+ Cloud infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a third-party provider.

***Characteristics:***


+ Control: Greater control over security and data privacy.

+ Customization: Tailored to meet specific business needs.

+ Cost: Can be more expensive due to hardware and management costs.

+ Examples: AWS Outposts (brings AWS services to your data center), AWS Local Zones.

+ Use Cases: Ideal for businesses with stringent regulatory or data privacy requirements, or those needing specialized hardware or configurations.

### 3. Hybrid Cloud

***Description:***

+ Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

***Characteristics:***


+ Flexibility: Leverages the benefits of both public and private clouds.

+ Integration: Requires seamless integration between on-premises infrastructure and cloud services.

+ Cost Efficiency: Balances between the cost of private cloud and the scalability of the public cloud.

+ Examples: AWS Direct Connect (for private connectivity to AWS), AWS Storage Gateway (integrates on-premises storage with cloud storage).

+ Use Cases: Suitable for businesses needing a balance between on-premises and cloud resources, such as disaster recovery, data backup, or regulatory compliance scenarios.

### 4. Community Cloud

***Description:*** 

+ Shared infrastructure for a specific community with common interests, managed either by organizations within the community or by a third-party provider.

***Characteristics:***


+ Shared Resources: Resources are shared among several organizations with similar needs.

+ Collaboration: Facilitates collaboration and information sharing within the community.

+ Cost Sharing: Costs are shared among the participating organizations.

+ Examples: AWS doesnâ€™t have a direct community cloud service but allows for shared environments via VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) setups and Resource Access Manager.

+ Use Cases: Suitable for government agencies, healthcare organizations, or educational institutions that need to share resources and data while maintaining some level of privacy and control.


## AWS Global Infrastructure

<img src="aws_global_infra.png">

### AWS Global Infrastructure


+ AWS is a cloud computing platform which is globally available.

+ Global infrastructure is a region around the world in which AWS is based. Global infrastructure is a bunch of high-level IT services which is shown below:

+ The following are the components that make up the AWS infrastructure:

    + <span style="color: blue">      Availability Zones
    + <span style="color: red"> Region
    + <span style="color: green"> Edge locations
    + <span style="color: white"> Regional Edge Caches

### 1. Availability zone as a Data Center

+ An availability zone is a facility that can be somewhere in a country or in a city. Inside this facility, i.e., Data Centre, we can have multiple servers, switches, load balancing, firewalls. The things which interact with the cloud sits inside the data centers.

+ An availability zone can be a several data centers, but if they are close together, they are counted as 1 availability zone.


### 2. Region


+ A region is a geographical area. Each region consists of 2 more availability zones.

+ A region is a collection of data centers which are completely isolated from other regions.

+ A region consists of more than two availability zones connected to each other through links.

### 3. Edge Locations


+ Edge locations are the endpoints for AWS used for caching content.

+ Edge locations consist of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN).

+ Edge locations are more than regions. Currently, there are over 150 edge locations.

+ Edge location is not a region but a small location that AWS have. It is used for caching the content.

+ Edge locations are mainly located in most of the major cities to distribute the content to end users with reduced latency.

### 4. Regional Edge Cache


+ AWS announced a new type of edge location in November 2016, known as a Regional Edge Cache.

+ Regional Edge cache lies between CloudFront Origin servers and the edge locations.

+ A regional edge cache has a large cache than an individual edge location.

+ Data is removed from the cache at the edge location while the data is retained at the Regional Edge Caches.



## AWS IAM

<img src="IAM.png">

<br>

### 1. User

***Definition:***
+ An IAM user is an entity that represents a person or application that interacts with AWS resources.

***Purpose:***

+ IAM users have credentials (username and password or access keys) that allow them to access AWS services and resources.

***Management:***
+ Users can be managed individually, and their permissions are controlled through policies attached to their account.

### 2. User Groups

***Definition:***

+ A user group is a collection of IAM users.

***Purpose:***

+ User groups simplify the management of permissions by allowing you to assign permissions to a group rather than to individual users. Any user added to the group inherits the group's permissions.

***Management:***

+ You can create and manage user groups in the IAM console, and attach policies to these groups to define what actions members can perform.

### 3. Policies

***Definition:*** 

+ Policies are documents that define permissions. They are written in JSON and specify what actions are allowed or denied for specific resources.

***Purpose:*** 

+ Policies control access to AWS resources by granting or denying permissions based on the policies' rules. Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.

***Management:***

+ AWS provides managed policies (predefined by AWS) and you can also create custom policies to meet specific needs.

### 4. Custom Policies

***Definition:***

+ Custom policies are user-defined policies created to provide tailored permissions that fit specific use cases.

***Purpose:*** 

+ Custom policies allow more granular control over access compared to managed policies, which are more generic.

***Management:*** 

+ You create and edit custom policies using the IAM policy editor in the AWS Management Console, and attach them to users, groups, or roles as needed.

### 5. Roles

***Definition:*** 

+ An IAM role is an AWS identity with specific permissions that can be assumed by users or services.

***Purpose:*** 

+ Roles are used to delegate permissions to entities like IAM users, AWS services, or applications. Roles are particularly useful for cross-account access or when granting permissions to AWS services to perform actions on your behalf.

***Management:*** 

+ Roles include policies that define what actions the role can perform. A role does not have permanent credentials but is assumed by trusted entities to temporarily gain the permissions associated with the role.


## Credential Rotation

<img src="Manage-AWS-Directory-Service-credentials-1.jpg">


<br>

**Definition:**

+ The practice of regularly changing or updating credentials (like passwords, API keys, or access tokens) to enhance security.

**Purpose:**

+ Minimizes the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised.

**Frequency:**

+ Depends on policy; can be monthly, quarterly, or yearly.

**Implementation:**

+ Often automated via tools to avoid manual errors and ensure compliance.

**Best Practices:**

+ Use strong, unique credentials; update all systems and applications with new credentials; monitor for any access issues

## Multifactor Authentication

<img src="mfa.jpeg">

<br>

### **Definition:**

+ A security mechanism that requires two or more forms of verification to access an account or system.

+ **Components:**
    
    + Something You Know: Password or PIN.
    
    + Something You Have: Security token, smartphone app, or physical card.
    
    + Something You Are: Biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition.

**Purpose:**

+ Provides an additional layer of security beyond just a password.

**Types:** 

+ SMS codes, email links, authentication apps, biometric scans.

**Implementation:** 

+ Configured on user accounts, applications, and systems to ensure comprehensive security.
