# Notes:

## Auto-Scaling


### AWS Auto Scaling

+ AWS auto-scaling is used to scale up and scale down the EC2-instance by depending on the incoming traffic. 

+ You can scale up and scale down the applications in a few minutes based on the traffic which will decrease the latency of the application to the end-users. 

+ You can integrate the AWS Auto Scaling with multiple services provided by AWS like Amazon traffic, Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Aurora. 

+ You can also decrease the cost of an application because of dynamic scaling. 

+ When there is traffic, only maximum resources are used other it will use minimum resources.


### Benefits of Auto Scaling

**Dynamical scaling:** 

+ AWS auto-scaling service doesnâ€™t require any type of manual intervention it will automatically scale the application down and up by depending up on the incoming traffic.

**Pay For You Use:** 
+ In auto scaling the resource will be utilised in the optimised way where the demand is low the resource utilisation will be low and the demand will high the resource utilisation will increase so the AWS is going to charge you only for the amount of resources you really used.

**Automatic Performance Maintenance:** 

+ AWS auto scaling maintains the optimal application performance with considering the workloads it will ensures that the application is running to desired level which will decrease the latency and also the capacity will be increased by based on your application


### What is Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?

+ Amazon EC2 auto-scaling will helps you to scale the resources of EC2 depending on the demand of incoming traffic. It will maintain the high availability and optimize the cost of AWS EC2.

+ EC2 Auto Scaling is will helps to create collection of EC2 instances called an Autoscaling group where load balancer will transfer the load to this instances. 

+ The minimum, maximum, and preferred capacity for your Auto Scaling group can then be specified. 

+ To keep instances running at the appropriate capacity, EC2 Auto Scaling will start and stop them automatically.


## Types Of AWS Autoscaling

### Vertical Autoscaling:

**Definition:**

+ Adjusts the resources of a single instance (e.g., CPU, RAM).

**Scale Up:**

+ Increase instance size or resources.

**Scale Down:**

+ Decrease instance size or resources.

**Use Case:**

+  Ideal for applications requiring more power on a single instance.

**Limitations:**

+ May involve downtime; limited by instance type choices.

### Horizontal Autoscaling:

**Definition:**

+ Adds or removes instances in a fleet to handle load.

**Scale Out:**

+ Increase the number of instances.

**Scale In:**

+ Decrease the number of instances.

**Use Case:**

+ Ideal for distributed applications or load balancing.

**Benefits:**

+ Improves availability and fault tolerance; can handle large volumes of traffic.
